## Linting

We enforce some style rules for code in this repository using [eslint](http://eslint.org/). You can install a linting addon to a lot of editors and IDEs that will follow our linting rules.

## git

This repository will be using a forking model.

After you've made changes to your fork, committed them, and pushed them, open a pull request against `master`.

Travis CI will run regression checks on your branch and post the results on the PR.

When merging into `master`, choose to squash commits when it makes sense.
